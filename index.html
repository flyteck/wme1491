				<div class="trait-body">Gnash is tall, gangly, and imposing. His frame is lean, but he's big boned, lending weight to his prescence. His eyes are deep crimson, with unsettling black sclera. His gaze is piercing and unblinking, following the target of his attention intently. His markings form a line of sharp white teeth that trail down to his tail, extending the outline of his mouth into enormous maw. His mane and feathers grow long and wild, adding to his unkempt appearance.</div>

				<h2>In Depth</h2>
				<div class="header">Gnash is a friend to nobody,</div>
				<div class="trait-body">but not for any lack of desire. He, in fact, may have a bit too <i>much</i> of it.</div>
				<div class="text-body">Behind his gangly, menacing exterior, lurks a lonely mind. But his many years of isolation have served his social graces poorly. Gnash has a tendancy to fixate on new things, often animals, and <i>especially</i> other equids.</div>
				<div class="text-body">But, what then? He does not know how to approach, nor what to say - nor what he'd want from them, if he did. So he stares. He follows from a distance, a silent shadow full of teeth, watching something he cannot understand.</div>
				<div class="text-body">Is he even an equid? He's unsure. Others are even less certain. But he knows that they're the most similar creature to him that he has seen.</div>
				<div class="header">And so, he follows.</div>
				<div class="trait-body">Any creature that travels through Gnash's normal haunts is likely to feel his eyes on their back. He can be hard to spot, lurking in the distance, but his presence is always felt.</div>
				<div class="text-body">He will only leave his home range in pursuit of his current fascination, taking days or sometimes weeks to lose interest. Creatures that run will often lose him - he doesn't give chase, only wanders slowly along after. If confronted, he mirrors his obsession's demeanor - so approaching kindly is wise.</div>

				<h2>His Myth</h2>
				<div class="header">Nobody knows where Gnash came from.</div>
				<div class="trait-body">One day, he simply was.</div>
				<div class="text-body">He awoke on the dusty, dead, ground; below a stand of blackened pine trees. He was alive, and he was alone. He spent his early days wandering through the forest, encountering scarcely little life. A crow here, a starving rat there. He gnawed the blackened branches of trees, and the dried bones of rats. He felt no hunger, only emptiness.</div>
				<div class="text-body">Then, he saw a flock of crows together. They squawked, they squabbled. They <i>preened</i> each other.</div>

				<div class="header">Gnash felt something stir within his emptiness.</div>
				<div class="trait-body">What was this? He didn't know - but he wanted it for himself.</div>
				<div class="text-body">He didn't understand it, but he needed to. He approached the crows, and they scattered, jeering at him as they dissapeared into the trees.</div>
				<div class="text-body">The feeling twisted, becoming hot and painful. He reared, and screamed to the sky, drowning out the sound of the mocking crows. His call echoed through the trees before fading into still silence once more.</div>
				<div class="text-body">Still filled with fire and bees, he stalked through the dead forest once more. He heard the sound of grinding teeth in the brambles ahead. His pace quickened. A rat. Something to fill his void. The gnawing fell silent, but he knew where it had come from. He stuck a hoof into the thorns, and the rat leapt from the other side, skittering away.</div>

				<div class="header">Not again,</div>
				<div class="trait-body">He thought, desperation coursing through him.</div>
				<div class="text-body">He lunged after it, teeth grasping it by the neck. There was a crunch between his teeth, and the rat hung limply from his mouth. He lay it softly down on the ground, and sniffed at it. Something had changed. He... had made something change. He stepped back. This was not what he wanted. This could not give what he wanted, anymore.</div>
				<div class="text-body">He backed away, turned away, left.</div>
				<div class="text-body">Clearly, he did not understand... but he had to. And so, he follows.</div>
