  { name: "CandyApple", dialogue: "Toffee apples (in Commonwealth English) or candy apples (in American English) are whole apples covered in a sugar candy coating, with a stick inserted as a handle. These are a common treat at fall festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night, because these festivals occur in the wake of annual apple harvests.[1] Although toffee apples and caramel apples may seem similar, they are made using distinctly different processes."},
